  

# CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH  
Semicolon-separated list of directories specifying installation
prefixes to be searched by the find_package(),
find_program(), find_library(), find_file(), and
find_path() commands.  Each command will add appropriate
subdirectories (like bin, lib, or include) as specified in its own
documentation.  

By default this is empty.  It is intended to be set by the project.  

See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH,
CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH, CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH, and
CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH.
