  

# PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY  
Output directory for the MS debug symbols .pdb file
generated by the linker for an executable or shared library target.  

This property specifies the directory into which the MS debug symbols
will be placed by the linker. The property value may use
generator expressions.
Multi-configuration generators append a per-configuration
subdirectory to the specified directory unless a generator expression
is used.  

This property is initialized by the value of the
CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY variable if it is
set when a target is created.  


Note
This property does not apply to STATIC library targets because no linker
is invoked to produce them so they have no linker-generated .pdb file
containing debug symbols.
The linker-generated program database files are specified by the
/pdb linker flag and are not the same as compiler-generated
program database files specified by the /Fd compiler flag.
Use the COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property to specify the latter.
