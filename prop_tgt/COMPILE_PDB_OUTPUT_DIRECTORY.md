  

# COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY  
Output directory for the MS debug symbol .pdb file
generated by the compiler while building source files.  

This property specifies the directory into which the MS debug symbols
will be placed by the compiler.  This property is initialized by the
value of the CMAKE_COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY variable
if it is set when a target is created.  


Note
The compiler-generated program database files are specified by the
/Fd compiler flag and are not the same as linker-generated
program database files specified by the /pdb linker flag.
Use the PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property to specify the latter.
