The extra generator used to build the project.  See
cmake-generators(7).  

When using the Eclipse, CodeBlocks, CodeLite, Kate or Sublime generators, CMake
generates Makefiles (CMAKE_GENERATOR) and additionally project
files for the respective IDE.  This IDE project file generator is stored in
CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR (e.g.  Eclipse CDT4).
