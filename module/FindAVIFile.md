Locate AVIFILE library and include paths  

AVIFILE (http://avifile.sourceforge.net/) is a set of libraries for
i386 machines to use various AVI codecs.  Support is limited beyond
Linux.  Windows provides native AVI support, and so doesn¡¯t need this
library.  This module defines  

AVIFILE_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find avifile.h , etc.
AVIFILE_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against
AVIFILE_DEFINITIONS, definitions to use when compiling
AVIFILE_FOUND, If false, don't try to use AVIFILE
