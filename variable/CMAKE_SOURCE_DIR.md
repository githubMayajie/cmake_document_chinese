The path to the top level of the source tree.  

This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake source
tree.  For an in-source build, this would be the same as
CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.  

When run in -P script mode, CMake sets the variables
CMAKE_BINARY_DIR, CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR,
CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR and
CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR to the current working directory.
