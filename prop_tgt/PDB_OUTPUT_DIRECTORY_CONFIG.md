  

# PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_```<CONFIG>```  
Per-configuration output directory for the MS debug symbol .pdb file
generated by the linker for an executable or shared library target.  

This is a per-configuration version of PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY,
but multi-configuration generators (Visual Studio Generators,
Xcode) do NOT append a
per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This
property is initialized by the value of the
CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_```<CONFIG>``` variable if it is
set when a target is created.  

Contents of PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_```<CONFIG>``` may use
generator expressions.  


Note
This property does not apply to STATIC library targets because no linker
is invoked to produce them so they have no linker-generated .pdb file
containing debug symbols.
The linker-generated program database files are specified by the
/pdb linker flag and are not the same as compiler-generated
program database files specified by the /Fd compiler flag.
Use the COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_```<CONFIG>``` property to specify the latter.
