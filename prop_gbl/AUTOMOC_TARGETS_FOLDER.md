  

# AUTOMOC_TARGETS_FOLDER  
Name of FOLDER for *_autogen targets that are added automatically by
CMake for targets for which AUTOMOC is enabled.  

This property is obsolete.  Use AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER instead.  

If not set, CMake uses the FOLDER property of the parent target as a
default value for this property.  See also the documentation for the
FOLDER target property and the AUTOMOC target property.
