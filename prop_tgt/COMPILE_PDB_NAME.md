  

# COMPILE_PDB_NAME  
Output name for the MS debug symbol .pdb file generated by the
compiler while building source files.  

This property specifies the base name for the debug symbols file.
If not set, the default is unspecified.  


Note
The compiler-generated program database files are specified by the
/Fd compiler flag and are not the same as linker-generated
program database files specified by the /pdb linker flag.
Use the PDB_NAME property to specify the latter.
