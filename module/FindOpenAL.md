Finds Open Audio Library (OpenAL).
This module defines OPENAL_LIBRARY OPENAL_FOUND, if
false, do not try to link to OpenAL OPENAL_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find
the headers.  

$OPENALDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure --prefix=$OPENALDIR used in building OpenAL.  

Created by Eric Wing.  This was influenced by the FindSDL.cmake
module.
