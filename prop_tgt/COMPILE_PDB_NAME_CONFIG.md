  

# COMPILE_PDB_NAME_```<CONFIG>```  
Per-configuration output name for the MS debug symbol .pdb file
generated by the compiler while building source files.  

This is the configuration-specific version of COMPILE_PDB_NAME.  


Note
The compiler-generated program database files are specified by the
/Fd compiler flag and are not the same as linker-generated
program database files specified by the /pdb linker flag.
Use the PDB_NAME_```<CONFIG>``` property to specify the latter.
