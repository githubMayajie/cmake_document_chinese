Name of FOLDER for *_autogen targets that are added
automatically by CMake for targets for which AUTOMOC is enabled.  

If not set, CMake uses the FOLDER property of the parent target as a
default value for this property.  See also the documentation for the
FOLDER target property and the AUTOMOC target property.
