Semicolon-separated list of directories specifying a search path
for the find_file() and find_path() commands.  By default
this contains the standard directories for the current system.  It is not
intended to be modified by the project; use CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH for
this.  See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.
