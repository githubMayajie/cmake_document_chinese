For CMake 2.4 compatibility only.  Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
instead.  

This read-only property specifies the list of flags given so far to
the add_definitions() command.  It is intended for debugging
purposes.  Use the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS directory property
instead.  

This built-in read-only property does not exist if policy
CMP0059 is set to NEW.
