  

# PDB_NAME  
Output name for the MS debug symbol .pdb file generated by the
linker for an executable or shared library target.  

This property specifies the base name for the debug symbols file.
If not set, the OUTPUT_NAME target property value or
logical target name is used by default.  


Note
This property does not apply to STATIC library targets because no linker
is invoked to produce them so they have no linker-generated .pdb file
containing debug symbols.
The linker-generated program database files are specified by the
/pdb linker flag and are not the same as compiler-generated
program database files specified by the /Fd compiler flag.
Use the COMPILE_PDB_NAME property to specify the latter.
