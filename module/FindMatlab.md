Finds Matlab or Matlab Compiler Runtime (MCR) and provides Matlab tools,
libraries and compilers to CMake.  

This package primary purpose is to find the libraries associated with Matlab
or the MCR in order to be able to build Matlab extensions (mex files). It
can also be used:  


to run specific commands in Matlab in case Matlab is available
for declaring Matlab unit test
to retrieve various information from Matlab (mex extensions, versions and
release queries, бн)
  

The module supports the following components:  


ENG_LIBRARY and MAT_LIBRARY: respectively the ENG and MAT
libraries of Matlab
MAIN_PROGRAM the Matlab binary program. Note that this component is not
available on the MCR version, and will yield an error if the MCR is found
instead of the regular Matlab installation.
MEX_COMPILER the MEX compiler.
MCC_COMPILER the MCC compiler, included with the Matlab Compiler add-on.
SIMULINK the Simulink environment.
  


Note
The version given to the find_package() directive is the Matlab
version, which should not be confused with the Matlab release name
(eg. R2014).
The matlab_get_version_from_release_name() and
matlab_get_release_name_from_version() provide a mapping
between the release name and the version.
  

The variable Matlab_ROOT_DIR may be specified in order to give
the path of the desired Matlab version. Otherwise, the behaviour is platform
specific:  


Windows: The installed versions of Matlab/MCR are retrieved from the
Windows registry
OS X: The installed versions of Matlab/MCR are given by the MATLAB
default installation paths in /Application. If no such application is
found, it falls back to the one that might be accessible from the PATH.
Unix: The desired Matlab should be accessible from the PATH. This does
not work for MCR installation and Matlab_ROOT_DIR should be
specified on this platform.
  

Additional information is provided when MATLAB_FIND_DEBUG is set.
When a Matlab/MCR installation is found automatically and the MATLAB_VERSION
is not given, the version is queried from Matlab directly (on Windows this
may pop up a Matlab window) or from the MCR installation.  

The mapping of the release names and the version of Matlab is performed by
defining pairs (name, version).  The variable
MATLAB_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS may be provided before the call to
the find_package() in order to handle additional versions.  

A Matlab scripts can be added to the set of tests using the
matlab_add_unit_test(). By default, the Matlab unit test framework
will be used (>```= 2013a) to run this script, but regular .m files
returning an exit code can be used as well (0 indicating a success).

Known issues

Symbol clash in a MEX target
By default, every symbols inside a MEX
file defined with the command matlab_add_mex() have hidden
visibility, except for the entry point. This is the default behaviour of
the MEX compiler, which lowers the risk of symbol collision between the
libraries shipped with Matlab, and the libraries to which the MEX file is
linking to. This is also the default on Windows platforms.
However, this is not sufficient in certain case, where for instance your
MEX file is linking against libraries that are already loaded by Matlab,
even if those libraries have different SONAMES.
A possible solution is to hide the symbols of the libraries to which the
MEX target is linking to. This can be achieved in GNU GCC compilers with
the linker option -Wl,--exclude-libs,ALL.

Tests using GPU resources
in case your MEX file is using the GPU and
in order to be able to run unit tests on this MEX file, the GPU resources
should be properly released by Matlab. A possible solution is to make
Matlab aware of the use of the GPU resources in the session, which can be
performed by a command such as D = gpuDevice() at the beginning of
the test script (or via a fixture).

  


Reference


Matlab_ROOT_DIR
The root folder of the Matlab installation. If set before the call to
find_package(), the module will look for the components in that
path. If not set, then an automatic search of Matlab
will be performed. If set, it should point to a valid version of Matlab.



MATLAB_FIND_DEBUG
If set, the lookup of Matlab and the intermediate configuration steps are
outputted to the console.



MATLAB_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS
If set, specifies additional versions of Matlab that may be looked for.
The variable should be a list of strings, organised by pairs of release
name and versions, such as follows:
set(MATLAB_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS
    "release_name1=corresponding_version1"
    "release_name2=corresponding_version2"
    ...
    )


Example:
set(MATLAB_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS
    "R2013b=8.2"
    "R2013a=8.1"
    "R2012b=8.0")


The order of entries in this list matters when several versions of
Matlab are installed. The priority is set according to the ordering in
this list.



matlab_get_version_from_release_name
Returns the version of Matlab (17.58) from a release name (R2017k)



matlab_get_release_name_from_version
Returns the release name (R2017k) from the version of Matlab (17.58)



matlab_extract_all_installed_versions_from_registry
This function parses the registry and founds the Matlab versions that are
installed. The found versions are returned in matlab_versions.
Set win64 to TRUE if the 64 bit version of Matlab should be looked for
The returned list contains all versions under
HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Mathworks\\MATLAB and
HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Mathworks\\MATLAB Runtime or an empty list in case an
error occurred (or nothing found).

Note
Only the versions are provided. No check is made over the existence of the
installation referenced in the registry,




matlab_get_all_valid_matlab_roots_from_registry
Populates the Matlab root with valid versions of Matlab or
Matlab Runtime (MCR).
The returned matlab_roots is organized in triplets
(type,version_number,matlab_root_path), where type
indicates either MATLAB or MCR.
matlab_get_all_valid_matlab_roots_from_registry(
    matlab_versions
    matlab_roots)



matlab_versions
the versions of each of the Matlab or MCR installations
matlab_roots
the location of each of the Matlab or MCR installations




matlab_get_mex_suffix
Returns the extension of the mex files (the suffixes).
This function should not be called before the appropriate Matlab root has
been found.
matlab_get_mex_suffix(
    matlab_root
    mex_suffix)



matlab_root
the root of the Matlab/MCR installation
mex_suffix
the variable name in which the suffix will be returned.




matlab_get_version_from_matlab_run
This function runs Matlab program specified on arguments and extracts its
version. If the path provided for the Matlab installation points to an MCR
installation, the version is extracted from the installed files.
matlab_get_version_from_matlab_run(
    matlab_binary_path
    matlab_list_versions)



matlab_binary_path
the location of the matlab binary executable
matlab_list_versions
the version extracted from Matlab




matlab_add_unit_test
Adds a Matlab unit test to the test set of cmake/ctest.
This command requires the component MAIN_PROGRAM and hence is not
available for an MCR installation.
The unit test uses the Matlab unittest framework (default, available
starting Matlab 2013b+) except if the option NO_UNITTEST_FRAMEWORK
is given.
The function expects one Matlab test script file to be given.
In the case NO_UNITTEST_FRAMEWORK is given, the unittest script file
should contain the script to be run, plus an exit command with the exit
value. This exit value will be passed to the ctest framework (0 success,
non 0 failure). Additional arguments accepted by add_test() can be
passed through TEST_ARGS (eg. CONFIGURATION ```<config>``` ...).
matlab_add_unit_test(
    NAME ```<name>```
    UNITTEST_FILE matlab_file_containing_unittest.m
    [CUSTOM_TEST_COMMAND matlab_command_to_run_as_test]
    [UNITTEST_PRECOMMAND matlab_command_to_run]
    [TIMEOUT timeout]
    [ADDITIONAL_PATH path1 [path2 ...]]
    [MATLAB_ADDITIONAL_STARTUP_OPTIONS option1 [option2 ...]]
    [TEST_ARGS arg1 [arg2 ...]]
    [NO_UNITTEST_FRAMEWORK]
    )


The function arguments are:

NAME
name of the unittest in ctest.
UNITTEST_FILE
the matlab unittest file. Its path will be automatically
added to the Matlab path.
CUSTOM_TEST_COMMAND
Matlab script command to run as the test.
If this is not set, then the following is run:
runtests('matlab_file_name'), exit(max([ans(1,:).Failed]))
where matlab_file_name is the UNITTEST_FILE without the extension.
UNITTEST_PRECOMMAND
Matlab script command to be ran before the file
containing the test (eg. GPU device initialisation based on CMake
variables).
TIMEOUT
the test timeout in seconds. Defaults to 180 seconds as the
Matlab unit test may hang.
ADDITIONAL_PATH
a list of paths to add to the Matlab path prior to
running the unit test.
MATLAB_ADDITIONAL_STARTUP_OPTIONS
a list of additional option in order
to run Matlab from the command line.
-nosplash -nodesktop -nodisplay are always added.
TEST_ARGS
Additional options provided to the add_test command. These
options are added to the default options (eg. б░CONFIGURATIONS Releaseб▒)
NO_UNITTEST_FRAMEWORK
when set, indicates that the test should not
use the unittest framework of Matlab (available for versions >```= R2013a).
WORKING_DIRECTORY
This will be the working directory for the test. If specified it will
also be the output directory used for the log file of the test run.
If not specified the temporary directory ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/Matlab will
be used as the working directory and the log location.




matlab_add_mex
Adds a Matlab MEX target.
This commands compiles the given sources with the current tool-chain in
order to produce a MEX file. The final name of the produced output may be
specified, as well as additional link libraries, and a documentation entry
for the MEX file. Remaining arguments of the call are passed to the
add_library() or add_executable() command.
matlab_add_mex(
    NAME ```<name>```
    [EXECUTABLE | MODULE | SHARED]
    SRC src1 [src2 ...]
    [OUTPUT_NAME output_name]
    [DOCUMENTATION file.txt]
    [LINK_TO target1 target2 ...]
    [R2017b | R2018a]
    [...]
)



NAME
name of the target.
SRC
list of source files.
LINK_TO
a list of additional link dependencies.  The target links to libmex
and libmx by default.
OUTPUT_NAME
if given, overrides the default name. The default name is
the name of the target without any prefix and
with Matlab_MEX_EXTENSION suffix.
DOCUMENTATION
if given, the file file.txt will be considered as
being the documentation file for the MEX file. This file is copied into
the same folder without any processing, with the same name as the final
mex file, and with extension .m. In that case, typing help ```<name>```
in Matlab prints the documentation contained in this file.
R2017b or R2018a may be given to specify the version of the C API
to use: R2017b specifies the traditional (separate complex) C API,
and corresponds to the -R2017b flag for the mex command. R2018a
specifies the new interleaved complex C API, and corresponds to the
-R2018a flag for the mex command. Ignored if MATLAB version prior
to R2018a. Defaults to R2017b.
MODULE or SHARED may be given to specify the type of library to be
created. EXECUTABLE may be given to create an executable instead of
a library. If no type is given explicitly, the type is SHARED.

The documentation file is not processed and should be in the following
format:
% This is the documentation
function ret = mex_target_output_name(input1)
