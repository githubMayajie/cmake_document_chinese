  

# LABELS  
Specify a list of text labels associated with a directory and all of its
subdirectories. This is equivalent to setting the LABELS target
property and the LABELS test property on all targets and tests in
the current directory and subdirectories. Note: Launchers must enabled to
propagate labels to targets.  

The CMAKE_DIRECTORY_LABELS variable can be used to initialize this
property.  

The list is reported in dashboard submissions.
