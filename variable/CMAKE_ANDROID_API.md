When Cross Compiling for Android with NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual Studio Edition, this variable may be set to specify the default value for the
ANDROID_API target property.  See that target property for
additional information.  

Otherwise, when Cross Compiling for Android, this variable provides
the Android API version number targeted.  This will be the same value as
the CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION variable for Android platforms.
