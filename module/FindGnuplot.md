  

# FindGnuplot  
this module looks for gnuplot  

Once done this will define  

GNUPLOT_FOUND - system has Gnuplot
GNUPLOT_EXECUTABLE - the Gnuplot executable
GNUPLOT_VERSION_STRING - the version of Gnuplot found (since CMake 2.8.8)

  

GNUPLOT_VERSION_STRING will not work for old versions like 3.7.1.
